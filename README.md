# Pang-TS
This is a browser-based space shooter game, Space Invaders alike, written in Typescript. I used [my starter ts-webpack project](https://github.com/nquocnghia/starter-ts-webpack) as a base.

I made this project in order to practise what I've learned in the Software Architecture course. That's why you'll find some of my choices of patterns are overkill. Well, I did it on purpose :blush:

#### How to run it ?
```bash
$ cd path/to/repo
$ npm run serve # dev server: open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

#### Todos:
- Save game feature
- More stages
